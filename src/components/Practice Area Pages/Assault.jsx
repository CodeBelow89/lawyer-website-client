        Knowledgeable Advocate for Misdemeanor Assault Cases Misdemeanor assault
        is generally classified as less severe than felony assault, but it can
        still carry significant consequences. Misdemeanor assault charges may
        fall into the following categories: Class A Misdemeanor: Causing bodily
        injury to another person without aggravating factors. Class B
        Misdemeanor: Committing assault during a sporting event or as
        retaliation for a sports performance. Class C Misdemeanor: Threatening
        bodily harm or making physical contact in a provocative manner without
        aggravating circumstances. A conviction for misdemeanor assault can lead
        to up to one year in jail and fines of up to $4,000, with lasting
        repercussions on your life. Depending on the specifics of the case,
        charges may escalate to felony status. I am dedicated to building a
        robust defense aimed at reducing or eliminating the charges against you.
        Aggressive Representation in Felony Assault Cases Felony assault charges
        carry severe penalties and can be categorized as: 1st Degree Felony:
        Aggravated assault resulting in serious injury or involving a weapon
        against domestic partners, public officials, first responders, or
        informants. 2nd Degree Felony: Assault against a family member or
        partner, particularly involving choking, especially if the defendant has
        prior convictions. 3rd Degree Felony: Assault against public servants,
        emergency personnel, or household members. Conviction for a felony
        assault can lead to up to 20 years in prison and fines reaching $10,000.
