        Being Charged with a Criminal Offense is Life-Changing. Facing Criminal
        Charges? Protect Your Freedom. If you’re under suspicion for a crime,
        the fear of losing your freedom can be overwhelming. A conviction could
        lead to imprisonment, heavy fines, and the loss of family, job, and
        reputation. Additionally, a felony conviction may strip you of certain
        constitutional rights and close off various career paths permanently. If
        you have children, a criminal charge can jeopardize your custody and
        visitation rights. With so much at stake, you need an experienced
        attorney who will fight for your rights.
