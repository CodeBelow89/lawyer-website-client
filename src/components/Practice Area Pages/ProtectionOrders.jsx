        your home, your workplace, and your children's schools. Cease-Abuse

        behavior toward you or your children. No-Contact Provisions: These
        prevent the accused from making any form of contact, including
        in-person, telephonic, electronic, or through third parties. Additional
        provisions may involve the surrendering of firearms, payment of spousal
        or child support, or granting you sole possession of shared vehicles or
        living spaces. Depending on jurisdiction, restraining orders can be
        issued by family courts, civil courts, or criminal courts. You can trust
