        Texas Attorney Specializes in Equitable Property Distribution
        Experienced Divorce Lawyer Defending Your Rights in San Antonio In
        Texas, assets acquired and liabilities incurred during a marriage are
        classified as marital property. Upon divorce or separation, these assets
        are subject to equitable distribution. When couples cannot reach an
        agreement, Texas courts will divide marital property fairly and
        equitably—though not necessarily equally. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I
        advocate for clients in the San Antonio area and across Texas, ensuring
        that their rights are protected and that marital property and debt are
        divided in a way that safeguards their financial interests.
        Detail-Oriented Advocate Committed to Protecting Your Assets Before
        marital property can be divided, assets must be accurately valued and
        classified as either marital or separate. Marital property consists of
        assets acquired during the marriage, while separate property includes
        assets obtained prior to the marriage and are exempt from division. With
        a deep understanding of Texas’s equitable distribution laws, I
        skillfully differentiate between marital and separate property. I am
        adept at tracing the commingling of separate and marital assets to
        prevent unfair distribution and ensure that no assets or debts are
        overlooked in the final settlement. Marital property may include: The
        marital home and vacation properties Stocks and bonds Automobiles Bank
        and investment accounts Home furnishings Timeshares Retirement funds
        Pensions and annuities Businesses Courts consider various factors when
        determining property division, including the financial situation and
        earning potential of each spouse, their contributions to acquiring
        marital property, and the future needs and liabilities of both parties.
        I will ensure the court has all pertinent information for a fair
        division of your assets. Dedicated Divorce Counselor Committed to
        Favorable Property Division Outcomes At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I aim to
