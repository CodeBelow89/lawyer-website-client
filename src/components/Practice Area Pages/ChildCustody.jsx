        Navigating Complex and Emotionally Charged Child Custody Matters
        Protecting Fathers' Rights in Texas In Texas, understanding the laws
        governing child custody can be a daunting task. Custody arrangements may
        designate both parents as joint managing conservators or assign sole
        managing conservatorship to one parent. When it comes to visitation
        schedules, parents may reach an agreement, or, if they cannot, the court
        will impose a possession and access plan tailored to your family's
        needs. Attorney Jacqueline Kriebel is a seasoned child custody attorney
        with a proven track record in handling a wide range of custody issues,
        from amicable arrangements to highly contested disputes involving
        parental alienation. She recognizes that achieving a mutually agreeable
        custody arrangement can be challenging. When negotiations fail, Ms.
        Kriebel is prepared to vigorously defend your rights in court. Finding
        the Optimal Arrangement for Your Family Is your current child custody
