        Understanding the laws governing child custody can be a daunting task.
        Custody arrangements may designate both parents as joint managing
        conservators or assign sole managing conservatorship to one parent. When
        it comes to visitation schedules, parents may reach an agreement, or, if
        they cannot, the court will impose a possessfion and access plan
        tailored to your family's needs. Attorney Jacqueline Kriebel is a
        seasoned child custody attorney with a proven track record in handling a
        wide range of custody issues, from amicable arrangements to highly
        contested disputes involving parental alienation. She recognizes that
        achieving a mutually agreeable custody arrangement can be challenging.
        When negotiations fail, Ms. Kriebel is prepared to vigorously defend
        your rights in court.{" "}
