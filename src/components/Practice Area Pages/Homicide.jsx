        Determined Texas Criminal Defense Lawyer Fighting for Clients Facing
        Homicide Charges Experienced Litigator Defending Clients in the San
        Antonio Area Accused of Unlawful Killing Homicide, defined as the
        unlawful killing of another person, carries severe penalties,
        potentially resulting in life imprisonment. If you are facing charges of
        murder, manslaughter, or any other violent crime, you need an
        experienced defense attorney who will fiercely advocate for your rights
        within the criminal justice system. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I possess
        the skill and tenacity to defend clients throughout San Antonio and
        Texas against homicide accusations. Depending on the specifics of your
        case, I will strive for the best possible outcome, whether that means an
        acquittal, a reduced sentence, or a favorable plea agreement. Tenacious
        Texas Advocate Offering a Range of Defenses to Murder and Manslaughter
        Charges Killings presumed to be willful and premeditated generally carry
        the harshest penalties. First-degree murder cases require a
        comprehensive investigation into the alleged crime and the defendant's
        actions. My objective is to work diligently to reduce charges whenever
        possible, potentially lowering them to second-degree murder or another
        classification where premeditation cannot be established. A killing
        without forethought, or a manslaughter charge lacking the requisite
        malice, can lead to more lenient sentencing. Depending on the
        circumstances of your case, I may present defenses based on: Mistaken
        identity Justified homicide (e.g., self-defense) Actions taken to
        protect others Accidental death occurring during lawful activities It is
        crucial to recognize that the burden of proof rests with the
        prosecution, and every defendant is presumed innocent until proven
        guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When I represent you, you can count on
        my zealous advocacy to uphold your rights from the very beginning of
        your case. Attorney Thoroughly Examining Evidence to Challenge
        Prosecutors’ Claims Homicide investigations often involve complex
        evidence, including scientific data and witness statements. Jurors
        typically place significant trust in forensic evidence, which can be a
        powerful tool in homicide cases. I meticulously review all relevant
        evidence—such as autopsy records, blood splatter analyses, firearm
        tests, and DNA reports—to bolster my clients' cases. I collaborate with
        expert forensic scientists who can provide compelling testimony.
        Additionally, I recognize that witnesses may deceive or misremember
        details under pressure from authorities. By conducting thorough
        investigations and leveraging my trial experience, I can effectively
        challenge false or unsupported statements. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I
