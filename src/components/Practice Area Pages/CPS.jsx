        Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) is tasked with

        sometimes stem from misunderstandings or mistakes, leading to
        unnecessary complications for your family. If you've received a call or
        visit from DFPS, it's crucial to contact an experienced family law
        attorney immediately to safeguard your rights and your children.

        your situation, she may be able to do the same for you. Call Kriebel Law

        The Challenges of Reunifying with Your Children DFPS has significant
        governmental backing, giving them considerable power. If they believe
        your child is in danger, they can arrive at your home with a warrant to

        process. To avoid such traumatic outcomes, it's vital to have
        knowledgeable legal support. An experienced attorney can guide you
        through the DFPS investigation process, inform you of what to expect,
        and advise you on best practices when dealing with the agency. This
        preparation can help you avoid missteps that could jeopardize your
        custody. Contact Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC to Protect Your Rights If DFPS
