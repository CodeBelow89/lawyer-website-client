        Assertive Texas Attorney Defending Clients Accused of Traffic Violations.
        Lawyer Fighting Tickets and Criminal Charges for Clients in the San
        Antonio Area. Traffic tickets and moving violations can significantly
        disrupt your life. Fees can accumulate quickly, and points on your
        record may lead to skyrocketing insurance premiums or even a revoked or
        suspended license. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I understand the stakes
        when you've been cited for a traffic violation. I represent clients
        throughout the San Antonio area and Texas in a variety of traffic
        offenses, diligently questioning law enforcement actions to seek
        reductions or dismissals of the charges against you. </p>

        Litigator Working to Dismiss or Reduce Charges </h1>
        <p className="paragraph"> Facing a criminal or
        civil charge for a traffic violation can lead to serious penalties if
        you plead guilty. Paying a fine without contesting the charge may seem
        easier, but it can have long-term consequences, such as increased
        insurance costs or subsequent tickets. An attorney from Kriebel Law
        Firm, PLLC can advocate for you in court, aiming to have your charges
        dropped or reduced to mitigate penalties. I handle a range of traffic
        violation cases in Texas, including: </p>
         
         <ul className="list">
         <li>Reckless driving </li>
         <li> Speeding </li>
         <li> Expired
        registration </li>
        <li> Expired license </li>
        <li> Running a red light or stop sign </li>
        <li> Failure to
        signal when changing lanes </li>
        <li> Failure to wear a seatbelt </li>

        <p className="paragraph"> I adopt a meticulous approach to traffic
        violation defense, thoroughly examining all aspects of your case,
        including the police report, to determine if law enforcement violated

        interviews to gather detailed information about the circumstances
        surrounding your violation. In some instances, the wrong driver may be
        cited due to another motorist's actions. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I
