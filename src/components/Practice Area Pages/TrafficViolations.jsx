        Assertive Texas Attorney Defending Clients Accused of Traffic Violations
        Lawyer Fighting Tickets and Criminal Charges for Clients in the San
        Antonio Area Traffic tickets and moving violations can significantly
        disrupt your life. Fees can accumulate quickly, and points on your
        record may lead to skyrocketing insurance premiums or even a revoked or
        suspended license. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I understand the stakes
        when you've been cited for a traffic violation. I represent clients
        throughout the San Antonio area and Texas in a variety of traffic
        offenses, diligently questioning law enforcement actions to seek
        reductions or dismissals of the charges against you. Skilled Texas
        Litigator Working to Dismiss or Reduce Charges Facing a criminal or
        civil charge for a traffic violation can lead to serious penalties if
        you plead guilty. Paying a fine without contesting the charge may seem
        easier, but it can have long-term consequences, such as increased
        insurance costs or subsequent tickets. An attorney from Kriebel Law
        Firm, PLLC can advocate for you in court, aiming to have your charges
        dropped or reduced to mitigate penalties. I handle a range of traffic
        violation cases in Texas, including: Reckless driving Speeding Expired
        registration Expired license Running a red light or stop sign Failure to
        signal when changing lanes Failure to wear a seatbelt Driving under the
        influence (DUI) Driving without a license or with a suspended license
        Leaving the scene of an accident Violating license restrictions
        Hit-and-run accidents With my knowledge and experience, I assert your
        rights and protect your interests in traffic court, addressing both
        moving and non-moving violations. Determined Counselor Building Strong
        and Strategic Defenses I adopt a meticulous approach to traffic
        violation defense, thoroughly examining all aspects of your case,
        including the police report, to determine if law enforcement violated
        your rights or failed to follow proper procedures. I also conduct
        interviews to gather detailed information about the circumstances
        surrounding your violation. In some instances, the wrong driver may be
        cited due to another motorist's actions. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I
        explore every scenario before deciding on the best strategy, and I am
        prepared to aggressively cross-examine witnesses during trial. Contact a
        Tenacious Texas Traffic Violation Lawyer At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC, I
        vigorously advocate for clients in Texas traffic courts. Call my San
        Antonio office at 210-677-5586 or contact me online to schedule a
