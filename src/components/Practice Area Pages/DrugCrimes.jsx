        <h1 className="heading">Knowledgeable Defense Attorney Challenging
        Drug Charges from Traffic Stops </h1>
        <p className="paragraph"> Many drug arrests arising from traffic
        stops may not be legally conducted. The initial stop might not hold up
        under scrutiny in court. Police often stop drivers for unrelated issues,
        such as speeding or a broken taillight, and may then request a vehicle
        search. However, officers need probable cause for such searches, and
        many drivers unknowingly consent to searches without realizing they can
        refuse. If you denied consent and the police searched your vehicle
        anyway, contact me immediately. If drugs were found without your
        knowledge—perhaps from a passenger—I will fight to protect your rights
        and seek to have the charges dismissed. I challenge the prosecution at
        every turn, examining whether the police had a legal reason for the
        stop, if any confession was coerced, or if unreliable informants were
        involved in your arrest. These factors can significantly impact the
        outcome of your case. </p>
