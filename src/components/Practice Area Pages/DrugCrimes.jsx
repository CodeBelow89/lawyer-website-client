        Aggressive Texas Law Firm Defending Clients Accused of Drug Crimes
        Assertive Defense Attorney Fighting for Your Rights in the San Antonio
        Area Drug charges are serious and can lead to severe consequences,
        including fines, jail time, job loss, school expulsion, and strained
        relationships. However, even in challenging situations, viable defenses
        exist. Entrusting your case to an experienced attorney significantly
        enhances your chances of a favorable outcome. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC,
        I work diligently to have confessions dismissed and to seek reductions
        or dismissals of charges. Additionally, I aim to place clients in
        rehabilitation programs instead of incarceration. If you’ve been accused
        of a drug-related crime in the San Antonio area or anywhere in Texas,
        I’m here to provide the dedicated defense you deserve. Committed Texas
        Lawyer Providing Relentless Defense of Your Rights Facing drug charges
        can feel overwhelming without a dedicated attorney by your side. You can
        count on me to mount a vigorous defense for your rights. At Kriebel Law
        Firm, PLLC, I represent clients charged with a wide range of state and
        federal drug crimes, including: Drug possession Possession with intent
        to sell Drug trafficking Driving under the influence of drugs
        Prescription drug fraud Manufacturing illegal substances Conspiracy to
        sell drugs Operation of a methamphetamine lab Sale of illegal substances
        in a school zone Possession of drug paraphernalia Your legal rights are
        my top priority, and I will tirelessly work to achieve a positive
        resolution for your case. Knowledgeable Defense Attorney Challenging
        Drug Charges from Traffic Stops Many drug arrests arising from traffic
        stops may not be legally conducted. The initial stop might not hold up
        under scrutiny in court. Police often stop drivers for unrelated issues,
        such as speeding or a broken taillight, and may then request a vehicle
        search. However, officers need probable cause for such searches, and
        many drivers unknowingly consent to searches without realizing they can
        refuse. If you denied consent and the police searched your vehicle
        anyway, contact me immediately. If drugs were found without your
        knowledge—perhaps from a passenger—I will fight to protect your rights
        and seek to have the charges dismissed. I challenge the prosecution at
        every turn, examining whether the police had a legal reason for the
        stop, if any confession was coerced, or if unreliable informants were
        involved in your arrest. These factors can significantly impact the
        outcome of your case. Contact a Strong Texas Criminal Defense Lawyer if
        You Face a Drug Charge If you’ve been charged with a drug crime, your
        future is at stake. At Kriebel Law Firm, PLLC in San Antonio, I will
